# Repository Workflow Contract

Repository workflows are reviewed as source-backed contracts. Workflow IDs, job IDs, artifact names, permissions, triggers, protected environments, and publication boundaries must match the checked-in YAML and the static workflow tests.

DevHud private packaging is manual-only or explicitly called by `release-devhud.yml`; `plan-only` is credential-free and `signed-private` is protected. Its OCI jobs generate and validate the ignored administrator production bundle before host-side Go tests, while the Docker build independently generates that same contracted structure inside its clean build boundary before compiling API and sweeper from one tree. The monthly `devhud-cef-security-review.yml` workflow is manual or scheduled monthly, has read-only contents permission, and may upload only its bounded metadata report artifact. It must not mutate source, pins, lockfiles, releases, stores, registries, deployments, alerts, or updater state.

Changes to DevHud workflows or these contracts must update `docs/apps-devhud-operations-contract.md`, `docs/apps-devhud-support-contract.md`, `docs/project-devhud.md`, the relevant release contract text, `AGENTS.md`, and `scripts/release/devhud-operations.test.mjs` together. `CI.yml` runs the static release/operations contract suite without contacting a controller or publication service.
