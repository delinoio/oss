### Instructions for `crates/`

- Follow root `AGENTS.md` and each crate-specific project document.
- Keep repository and domain rules in the appropriate `AGENTS.md` files.
- Write all source and comments in English.
- Prefer enums over free-form strings for stable internal and external contracts.

### Scope in This Domain

- `crates/cargo-mono`: Cargo-based Rust monorepo management CLI.
- `crates/nodeup`: Rust-based Node.js version manager.
- `crates/serde-feather`: Size-first serde runtime-facing core crate.
- `crates/serde-feather-macros`: Proc-macro companion crate for serde-feather.
- `crates/rustia`: Serde-based LLM JSON runtime crate.
- `crates/rustia-llm`: aisdk tool adapter crate for rustia-based function-calling input validation.
- `crates/rustia-macros`: Proc-macro derive companion crate for rustia.

### Rust Workspace Rules

- Add new crates as explicit workspace members in root `Cargo.toml`.
- Keep crate naming aligned with project IDs when possible.
- Document behavior contracts in project index docs and relevant crate-domain docs before large implementation changes.
- For new package scaffolding, default `publish = false` until publish contracts are explicitly approved.
- Prefer minimal default features and keep optional capabilities opt-in for size-sensitive crates.
- Keep proc-macro crates and runtime crates separated by explicit crate boundaries.

### nodeup-Specific Rules

- Preserve rustup-like shim behavior: symlink strategy plus executable-name dispatch.
- Keep channel and command identifiers stable and documented.
- Record storage and download behavior in project docs whenever changed.

### cargo-mono-Specific Rules

- Keep command identifiers stable and documented in `docs/project-cargo-mono.md` and `docs/crates-cargo-mono-foundation.md`.
- Preserve `cargo mono` subcommand compatibility (`cargo-mono` binary naming contract).
- Keep release-tag responsibility split: `bump` must not create tags, and `publish` may create tags only for packages listed in `[workspace.metadata.cargo-mono.publish.tag].packages`.
- Keep `publish` delegation aligned with the documented contract: `cargo mono publish` must invoke `cargo publish --no-verify` in both execute and dry-run modes.
- Ensure release automation (`bump`, `publish`) logs include structured operational context.
- Keep runtime error output on the fixed `Summary/Context/Hint` three-line contract and include only safe debugging context values.

### serde-feather-Specific Rules

- Keep `serde-feather` as the runtime-facing crate and `serde-feather-macros` as the proc-macro crate.
- Keep binary-size-first defaults: minimal default features and no convenience dependencies by default.
- Keep stable derive macro identifiers (`FeatherSerialize`, `FeatherDeserialize`) aligned with `docs/project-serde-feather.md` and crate component docs.

### rustia-Specific Rules

- Keep `rustia` as the runtime-facing crate, `rustia-llm` as the aisdk adapter crate, and `rustia-macros` as the proc-macro companion crate.
- Keep stable rustia identifiers (`Validate`, `IValidation`, `IValidationError`, `LLMData`, `LlmJsonParseResult`, `LlmJsonParseError`, `LlmToolInput`, `LlmToolOutput`, `LlmToolSpec`, `tool`, `LlmToolBuildError`, `LlmToolInputError`, `LlmToolExecutionError`, and `#[derive(LLMData)]`) synchronized with `docs/project-rustia.md`, `docs/crates-rustia-core-foundation.md`, `docs/crates-rustia-llm-foundation.md`, and `docs/crates-rustia-macros-foundation.md`.
- Keep non-contracted v0 identifiers explicitly documented as unstable until promoted in rustia contract docs.
- Keep future macro/runtime compatibility constraints synchronized with rustia project and crate contracts.

### Multi-Component Contract Sync

- `serde-feather` core crate changes must update `docs/crates-serde-feather-core-foundation.md` and `docs/project-serde-feather.md`.
- `serde-feather-macros` changes must update `docs/crates-serde-feather-macros-foundation.md` and `docs/project-serde-feather.md`.
- `rustia` core crate changes must update `docs/crates-rustia-core-foundation.md` and `docs/project-rustia.md`.
- `rustia-llm` crate changes must update `docs/crates-rustia-llm-foundation.md` and `docs/project-rustia.md`.
- `rustia-macros` crate changes must update `docs/crates-rustia-macros-foundation.md` and `docs/project-rustia.md`.

### Testing and Validation

- If Rust code changes in this domain, run `cargo test` from repository root.
- Keep logs sufficient for debugging install, dispatch, and runtime resolution flow.
- Keep CLI logs colorized by default for human operators, with explicit opt-out controls.
